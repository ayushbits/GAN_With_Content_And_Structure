# GAN_With_Content_And_Structure
- This repository is the implementation of following the idea:
Here, we  aim  to  learn  better  representations  by  exploiting
both  content  (or  feature)  information  of  nodes  and  structural
information  of  the  network.  Our  approach  leverages  generative
adversarial   networks   to   learn   embedding   for   generator   and
discriminator in a minimax game. While the generator estimates
the   neighborhood   of   a   node,   the   discriminator   distinguishes
between the presence or absence of a link for a pair of node
